ClamXAV is a professional-grade antivirus tool built for macOS that offers robust protection against a wide range of digital threats. Using a powerful scanning engine, it detects and neutralizes malware, spyware, adware, and ransomware before they can harm your system. The application is designed to be both powerful and easy to use, making it suitable for users of all experience levels.

Key features include real-time background scanning, which monitors files as they are accessed, and on-demand scanning for manual security checks. You can customize scan depths, exclude specific files or folders, and review detailed reports of detected items. Quarantine handling allows you to safely isolate suspicious files without deleting them immediately.

ClamXAV is optimized for all versions of macOS from Sierra to Sonoma and supports both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures. It runs quietly in the background, providing continuous security without interrupting your work or slowing down your Mac. With frequent updates to its threat database, ClamXAV ensures your device is protected against emerging malware strains.

Ideal for personal and business use, ClamXAV helps safeguard sensitive data, maintain privacy, and preserve system integrity. Its clear interface and reliable performance have made it a favorite among Mac users who prioritize security.
